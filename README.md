# RanDND

This repository contains a scanned treasure generator module that has been rewritten in Python.

## Usage
Run the Python script to start the menu-driven treasure generator:

```bash
python3 treasure_generator.py
```

The program offers several options for generating random maps, magic items, and treasure hoards, inspired by the original BASIC module.
